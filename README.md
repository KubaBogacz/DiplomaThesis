# Comparative Analysis of Algorithms for Signal Alignment Between Sequences Considering Outliers

This repository contains the code and data for the engineering thesis titled **"Comparative Analysis of Algorithms for Signal Alignment Between Sequences Considering Outliers"** by Jakub Bogacz from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The thesis focuses on evaluating the robustness of **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** and its variant, **Drop-DTW**, in the context of biomedical signal alignment.

## Key Points

### Objective
The study aims to assess the robustness of DTW and Drop-DTW algorithms in handling **noise and outliers**, which are common challenges in biomedical signal processing.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Data was collected from **healthy volunteers**.
- **Preprocessing**: Signals were preprocessed using **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**.
- **Evaluation**: Both quantitative (alignment cost) and qualitative (visual inspection) evaluations were performed to assess the algorithms.

### Findings
- **Resilience to Outliers**: Drop-DTW demonstrated better resilience to outliers compared to standard DTW.
- **Inconsistency Across Subjects**: The effectiveness of Drop-DTW was inconsistent across subjects, indicating a need for further validation.

### Limitations
- **Lack of Learnable Drop Cost Function**: The study did not incorporate a learnable drop cost function for dynamic adjustment.
- **Limited Dataset**: The dataset was limited to healthy individuals, which restricts the study's applicability to clinical settings.

### Future Directions
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Implementing machine learning techniques for improved alignment assessment.
- **Pathological Datasets**: Expanding research to include pathological datasets for better clinical relevance.

## Conclusion
The findings of this study contribute to advancing signal alignment methodologies, with potential applications in **personalized medicine and neuroscience research**.

## Results
Detailed results, including visualizations and performance metrics, are available in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks and output files within this repository.
